                    Fictional biography
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Yord Fandar was trained as a Padawan 
                    during the High Republic . He became 
                    best friends with Verosha Aniseya and, 
                    in 232 BBY, achieved the rank of Jedi 
                    Master. Two years later he took in the 
                    Zygerrian Tasi Lowa as a padawan. 4
                    Years after Verosha left the order, 
                    Yord and Tasi were sent for arrest 
                    after being framed for the murder of
                    Master Indara. Osha was detained and 
                    sent on a cell ship to Coruscant for 
                    interrogation. After a mutiny caused 
                    the ship to crash on an ice planet, 
                    leadership of the mission passed to 
                    Master Sol, who took Yord with him. 5
                    Once the group, made up of Yord, Sol 
                    and the padawan Jecki Lon, found Osha, 
                    they peacefully took her with them, 
                    also demonstrating that she was not 
                    responsible for the crimes, but that 
                    the real murderer had been her sister 
                    Mei, who was killed. I thought she had 
                    been dead for years. Yord began to 
                    regain his trust in Osha and confronted 
                    Mei shortly after she murdered Master 
                    Torbin, even though she ended up 
                    escaping from her.

                    on social networks, leading to the 
                    creation of numerous Internet memes 
                    involving Yord. Charlie Barnett, who 
                    plays the character, reacted to this 
                    online movement with the following 
                    statements:
                    Many friends and family have introduced 
                    me to my Orda Yoda. Anyone who can find 
                    love and support for someone who is just 
                    a little square... I love you deeply 
                    because that means you are a 
                    compassionate and caring human being who 
                    is out there to see the world better. 
                    Yord Horde, I love you. I love you deeply. 
                    And thank you very much. 7
                    On June 8, 2014, The Bongtimes published 
                    an article listing the best memes of the 
                    character created by fans, including one
                     that referenced the advertising slogan 
                     "She's everything. He's just Ken", from 
                     the movie Barbie. 2023. 8 Likewise, the
                      popularity of the character also led 
                      to the creation of the hashtag 
                      #YordeHorde on social networks. 9 
                      James Whitbrok, writing for the 
                      website Gizmodo , praised the 
                      character's inherently ironic nature
                       and how his rigid personality and 
                       efforts to remain faithful to the 
                       Jedi code make him stand out among 
                       the other characters in the series.
