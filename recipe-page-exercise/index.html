            Greek food meets Mexican food in this fusion

            chicken!

        <h1>THE CHIPOTLE CHICKEN</h1>
        <p>
            Let’s kick things off with the star of the show 
            – the chipotle chicken. This recipe is already 
            super popular on the blog and it is one of my 
            favorite weeknight dinners to make. It’s meant 
            to be a Chipotle restaurant copycat -it’s full 
            of so much flavor and spice. It’s delicious on 
            tacos, in rice bowls, a burrito, or even salad. 
            Now this recipes works well with chicken thighs 
            or chicken breast, it really just depends on 
            your taste and preference. 
            <p>
                Start by marinating the chicken in a bowl with 
            olive oil, garlic, chipotle adobo paste, chili 
            powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper. You can 
            buy a can of chipotle peppers in adobo paste 
            from most major supermarkets in the 
            international food aisle. Depending on the 
            store you go to, there will be different brands. 
            Any will do but my fave brand is Embasa! I only 
            use the adobo paste, not the peppers, in the can 
            for this recipe but if you would like it to be 
            spicy, you can add the whole can to a blender 
            and then add it in to make the sauce.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            You can marinate the chicken right before 
            cooking or if you have time, let it sit for 
            30 minutes, one hour, many hours, or even 
            overnight for maximum flavor. Cook the chicken 
            in a pan over medium-high heat until seared, 
            golden brown, and fully cooked through. If there 
            are some bits stuck to the pan, add a splash of 
            water to deglaze the pan and get the flavor back 
            on to the chicken.
        </p>
    
            <p>
                Tip: Don’t be afraid to play around with the 
                spice levels to suit your taste. Add more 
                chipotle peppers for extra heat or dial it back 
                if you prefer a milder flavor.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Also, you can choose to cook the thighs or 
                breast whole and then chop after cooked or chop 
                it before cooking and marinating. I have tried 
                both methods and both are great. I will say the 
                first method will result in a juicer chicken 
                though.
        </p>
        <h1>MAKING THE CRISPY FETA TACOS</h1>
        <p>
            Now, let’s talk about the game-changer that 
            makes this recipe unlike any other – the crispy 
            feta-crusted tortillas. Imagine a crispy 
            tortilla laced with a layer of grilled feta 
            cheese, creating a deliciously crunchy crust. 
            It’s the perfect complement to the smoky 
            chipotle chicken! Simply heat a skillet, 
            sprinkle on the feta cheese, and place a 
            tortilla on top until it crisps up to 
            perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> If you’re feeling adventurous, try 
            experimenting with different types of cheese 
            for the crust. Pepper jack if you love spice. 
            Monterey jack to keep it simple. Or parmesan if 
            you love its flavor!
        </p>
        <h1>
            THE FUN PART: TOPPINGS!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Time to bring it all together! Layer your 
            feta-crusted tortillas with shredded lettuce, 
            the chipotle chicken, creamy avocado, sweet 
            corn, and a dollop of sour cream. The 
            combination of flavors and textures is out of 
            this world! Don’t be shy to get creative with 
            your toppings – the more, the merrier. Some 
            other options include a delicious salsa, some 
            tomatoes or pico de gallo, guacamole, pinto 
            beans, or even some red onions!
        </p>
