            Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,IL) 
            canopy shyness,I] or inter-crown spacing(3]) 
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
            in which the crowns of fully stocked trees 
            do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps. +S The phenomenon is most 
            prevalent among trees of the same species, but 
            also occurs between trees of different species. 
            ]l7 There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research 
            suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
            leaf-eating insect larvae.
